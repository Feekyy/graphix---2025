Project work: making a 3D object placing program using openGL library, I used basic C for programming language and SDL library for the brige beetwen these two.

If you want to see for yourself the program, jsut clone my repo, then navigate your cmd into 'Project work' folder, then call 'make', and it will make an 'main.exe' file. Then just run it. (You will need that .dll file to make sure to work on most of the minGM-s.)
